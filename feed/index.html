<p>The team based at the University of Edinburgh and Technical University of Berlin are global leaders in the field and had already developed their own data processing system. We were asked to redevelop the system with two outcomes, make the data processing faster and create a process template to open up software development silos within the research teams.</p>



<p><strong>The science:</strong> Crosslinking Protein Research, both the structure of proteins and interactions between proteins and other molecules are studied. This is done by adding special chemicals called crosslinkers to a sample, cutting the proteins in that sample into smaller pieces, called peptides, and analysing those peptides in a mass spectroscope. Deriving the candidate peptides, and therefore the corresponding proteins, from the data produced by the mass spectroscope is a computationally complex problem: by calculating all potential spectra for all expected peptides we can match, through a statistical process, the mass spectroscope data to peptides and from that derive what parts of a protein, or which proteins, were a set distance apart at the time sample was prepared, and thus this provides information about the 3D structure of the protein or the interaction between proteins. The current software produced by the leading research teams in the field from two research institutes was the best available tool and they asked us to rewrite and improve it.</p>

<p>Using React Native we have created an instant messaging app which handles chats, messages, secure upload and export of assets, as well as push notifications to alert users of important updates. It also handles users who are employed by more than one company, so that they can retain access to all their information on one device whilst maintaining secure separation of data.We ensured that the messaging app has adhered to the branding and UI of its sister website application, so users can switch between the two apps seamlessly.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Technologies</strong>: Ionic, Cordova, Angular, Typescript, Ruby on Rails and Go</p>



<p>As well as designing and developing the hardware, firmware and infrastructure for the collar itself, we made an easy to use mobile App for pet owners and their families to keep track of their pet’s location and activity.We started off with a focus group of pet owners and worked together with them to identify the key requirements, putting together wireframes and getting user feedback at every stage of the journey. </p>



<p>The App gets regular updates from the collar itself, displaying the pet’s location on a Google map in real time. Users can set safe zones which trigger a push notification to the user and any associated accounts if the pet leaves this area. Users can see graphs of daily distance and activity time for their pets, as well as heat maps of frequently visited locations. Users can also trigger push notifications to associated devices using the Lost Pet function in the app. </p>



<p>The app is easily configurable for any users to be able to manage their notifications or the frequency of updates from the collar itself. As well as being an app which gives peace of mind to users who want to keep track of their pet’s location and health, it is also fun to use with colourful branding and customisable user input such as photos.</p>
