This is done by adding special chemicals called crosslinkers to a sample, cutting the proteins in that sample into smaller pieces, called peptides, and analysing those peptides in a mass spectroscope. Deriving the candidate peptides, and therefore the corresponding proteins, from the data produced by the mass spectroscope is a computationally complex problem: by calculating all potential spectra for all expected peptides we can match, through a statistical process, the mass spectroscope data to peptides and from that derive what parts of a protein, or which proteins, were a set distance apart at the time sample was prepared, and thus this provides information about the 3D structure of the protein or the interaction between proteins. The current software produced by the leading research teams in the field from two research institutes was the best available tool and they asked us to rewrite and improve it.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-container uagb-block-d90483e7 alignfull uagb-is-root-container\"><div class=\"uagb-container-inner-blocks-wrap\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-container uagb-block-f5a54370 alignfull uagb-is-root-container\"><div class=\"uagb-container-inner-blocks-wrap\">\n<h2 class=\"has-ast-global-color-0-color has-text-color wp-block-heading\">Outcomes<\/h2>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-container uagb-block-7b171a81 alignfull uagb-is-root-container\"><div class=\"uagb-container-inner-blocks-wrap\">\n<p>The software helps a wider range of researchers use, work with and contribute to the software.
